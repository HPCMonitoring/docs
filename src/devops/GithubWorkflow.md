# Github workflows settings

We recommend to run github runners inside [Linux container](https://linuxcontainers.org/lxc/introduction/) (`LXC`).

For details about self-hosted github runners, visit <https://docs.github.com/en/actions/hosting-your-own-runners/about-self-hosted-runners>.

For LXC installation and usage, you can visit our guides [here](./LXCContainer.md).
